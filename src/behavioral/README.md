### Behavioral design patterns (Behavioral)

**Behavioral design patterns** are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. **Behavioral patterns** do not just describe patterns of objects or classes, but also the patterns of communication between them. These patterns characterize control flows that are difficult to follow at runtime. They take the focus away from the flow of control to allow you to focus solely on the way objects are interconnected.

standards and intentions
The original **GoF behavioral design patterns** are:
- **Chain of responsibility** - avoids coupling the sender of a request to its recipient, giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chains the receiving objects and passes the request along the chain until an object handles it.
- **Command** - encapsulates a request as an object, thus allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log (log) requests, and support undoable operations.
- **Interpreter** - given a language, defines a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in that language.
- **Iterator** - provides a way to sequentially access the elements of an aggregate object without exposing its underlying representation.
- **Mediator** - defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. The mediator promotes loose coupling by preventing objects from explicitly referring to each other, allowing you to vary their interactions independently.
- **Memento** - without violating encapsulation, captures and externalizes an internal state of an object, so that it can later be restored to this state.
- **Observer** - defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when an object changes state, all of its dependents are automatically notified and updated.
- **State** - allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to have changed its class.
- **Strategy** - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one and making them interchangeable. The strategy allows the algorithm to vary independently of the clients that use it.
- **Template method** - defines the skeleton of an algorithm in one operation, deferring the definition of some steps to subclasses. The template method allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure.
- **Visitor** - represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object's structure. The visitor allows you to define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements it operates on.
