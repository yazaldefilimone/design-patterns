### Structural design patterns (structural)
Structural patterns are concerned with how objects are composed to form larger structures.

standards and intentions
**GoF's original structural design standards are**:

- **Adapter** - converts the interface of a class into another interface expected by clients. The Adapter allows certain classes to work together that would otherwise be impossible because of their incompatible interfaces.
- **Bridge** - separates an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
- **Composite** - Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite allows customers to uniformly treat individual objects and object compositions.
- **Decorator** - assigns additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
- **Facade** - provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces on a subsystem. The Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
- **Flyweight** - uses sharing to support large amounts of fine-grained objects efficiently.
- **Proxy** - provides a surrogate object, or a placeholder of another object to control access to it.
